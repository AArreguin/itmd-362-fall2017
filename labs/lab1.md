## ITMD 362, Lab 1: Cloning and Committing to a Git Repository

For this lab, you will fork, clone, and commit and push changes to a
remote GitHub repository. Follow the steps below exactly in order to receive full credit.

1. While logged into your GitHub account in your web browser, point your browser to
   https://github.com/dkriegls/itmd-362-fall2017/ and click the Fork button. You will then see
   that you have forked the Labs repository from `dkriegls/itmd-362-fall2017/tree/master/labs`

2. Once you have forked your own copy of the repository, go to your command line and change to
   whichever directory that youâ€™ve decided you will keep all of your different Git repositories.
   Clone your copy of your computer by clicking the Clone or download button on GitHub, and copying
   either the SSH or HTTPS clone address.

3. Follow GitHub's directions for cloning: https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-desktop/

3. Finally, post a link to your repository on GitHub, under the "Labs, ITMD-362" project. The title of your post will be "Lab1, your first and last name".
